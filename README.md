## scandium-dtls-clientserver
A DTLS application based on [Scandium/Californium][scandium] which is adapted from the example given in their repository but has a few more knobs that one can toy with.

It is used to test Scandium DTLS client/server implementations.
Branches provide support for different versions of Scandium.
The master (main) branch always follows the latest version of Scandium.

Originally, there were two separate projects, one for clients the other for servers.
We merged them together, since a lot of the code was duplicated across the two.
