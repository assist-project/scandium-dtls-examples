## scandium-dtls-server
A DTLS server application based on [Scandium/Californium][scandium] which is adapted from the example given in their repository but has a few more knobs that one can toy with.

It was used to test the Scandium DTLS implementations. 
There are two versions of Scandium available, 1.0.x, and 2.0.x. 
The APIs differ slightly between the two, hence we separate applications for each one of them. 
You can find those in the branches of this repo.
